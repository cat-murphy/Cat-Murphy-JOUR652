    <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <h3>Digital Intern</h3>
    <h4>NBC Connecticut</h4>
    <h5>June 2024-August 2024</h5>
    <p>
        I monitored statewide news stories and used news judgment to write breaking coverage of publication-worthy
        stories. In three months, I wrote and published 80 stories that drove 700,000 views and reached 400,000 unique
        viewers. Simultaneously, I helped managed NBC Connecticut’s home page, social accounts and push notifications. I
        also copyedited web scripts and cut, captioned, headlined, tagged and categorized video content for the web.
    </p>
    <h3>News Editor</h3>
    <h4>The Quinnipiac Chronicle</h4>
    <h5>April 2023-April 2024</h5>
    <p>
        Oversaw the independent student newspaper’s news section, assisting staffers and monitoring weekly coverage. I
        also used releases, public records and boots-on-the-ground reporting to amass over 130 reporting bylines
        covering a wide range of campus news topics. I also wrote headlines, captions, SEO titles and meta descriptions
        for all digital news content.
