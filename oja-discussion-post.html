    <h1>Cat Murphy's OJA Discussion Post Response</h1>

    Article: "<a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/08/nyregion/bronx-fire-nyc.html?searchResultPosition=9">The
        Chain of Failures That Left 17 Dead in a Bronx Apartment Fire,</a>" <em>The New York Times</em></li>

    <h2><strong>In one sentence, what is the topic of the story?</strong></h2>

    <p>
        The New York Times investigation examines the series of critical safety failures that turned a Bronx high-rise’s
        stairwells into chimneys, enabling the smoke from a third-floor apartment fire to spread upward and kill 17
        people.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Visually, what makes this story exciting or interesting?</strong></h2>

    <p>
        The story centers around the failure of several self-latching stairwell doors that, had they not
        malfunctioned, should have compartmentalized the smoke from the third-floor fire. But because they remained
        open, smoke entered the building’s side-by-side stairwells and filtered out on other floors with malfunctioning
        stairwell doors. The Times complemented its investigation of these failures with 3-D scroll-driven animations
        illustrating the exact path the smoke took on the day of the fire. And as far as the animations themselves go —
        they are outstanding. The methodology section indicates that The Times modeled the animations on official
        architectural drawings of the high-rise, but it’s so much more than just that. The Times coupled traditional
        reporting with innovative digital storytelling to design an interactive simulation that both shows and tells.
        The story narrates the series of safety failures that enabled the smoke to inundate the building while immersing
        readers in an animation that illustrates the narrative as it progresses.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>How are design fundamentals used in this presentation to help tell the story? What about specific design
            elements like typography and color?</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Contrast:</em> The baseline color scheme of the Times’ 3-D building model is monochromatic
            gray — in other words, the entirety of the model is, by default, grayed out. But as you scroll through the
            animated story, the elements of the building model relevant to the narrative appear in color. This is an
            intentional use of contrast, as the visual separation between the highlighted elements and the monochromatic
            base model allows readers to immediately understand which elements of the building are being described in
            the text. For instance, the animation uses the color blue to represent smoke. As the narrative progressively
            details the upward path of the smoke through the building, the corresponding animation shows the color blue
            overtaking the previously grayed out hallways and stairwells.
        </li>
        <li><em>Repetition:</em> Much of this piece’s repetitive design also revolves around the use of color. Case in
            point, the color orange is used consistently throughout the animation to depict the location of
            the events being described in the narrative. For instance, while quoting the resident of apartment 15K, the
            animation features a birds-eye view of the 15th floor, with apartment 15K outlined and highlighted in
            orange. Likewise, The Times created a visual timeline of the many 911 calls made during the fire, using
            orange boxes to show where in the building and at what time the calls were made.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>How are other presentation elements, interactive elements and interaction used to assist with
            storytelling?</strong></h2>

    <p>
        The excellence of the storytelling here has less to do with what the story had and more to do with what it
        didn’t have: An essay. In theory, this story could have been told with words alone. It could have been a
        2,300-word investigation into how the failure of a few doors allowed smoke to trap and suffocate residents 16
        floors above the fire. And to be clear, the story is actually 2,300 words long — I checked. But with few
        exceptions, there are never more than 50 or so words on screen at any one time. Rather, the animations are
        overlaid with short graphs that narrate and contextualize the illustrations as you scroll. Of course, 2,300
        words is a lot for one article — enough to dissuade many readers from reading past the first few graphs. But
        because the text appears only a sentence or two at a time, it becomes far less daunting in much the same way a
        picture book with 2,300 words seems easier to read than an article with 2,300 words. In other words, this story
        is defined by its interactivity — without it, the story would be just another long-form article.
        <br><br>
        And yet, the interactive animation isn’t the piece’s only storytelling tool. In addition to the building
        model, The Times included in its story photos and video of the actual incident. But instead of haphazardly
        inserting the photos and video, The Times matched its 3-D model exactly to the footage to seamlessly transition
        between the two. For instance, to explain that the stairwell doors on floors 15 and 19 likely malfunctioned, The
        Times highlights these floors in its animation before transitioning from the model to on-scene footage showing
        smoke billowing out of the windows on those floors. This may seem somewhat minor, but animations can only do so
        much to convey devastation. By incorporating into the animation images and videos of the real fire and its real
        consequences, the story becomes far more tangible.
        <br><br>
        Finally, the story includes a link to an NYT-designed augmented reality Instagram filter that demonstrates how
        quickly smoke can inhibit visibility. Again, this presentation feature makes the story more tangible and more
        relatable.
